# TRACTION Face and Object Recognition Module for the Co-Creation Space

Video face detection and recognition software based on RetinaFace and FaceNet. It requires the Co-Creation Space tool available in https://github.com/traction-project/CoCreationSpace.

## Documentation

The documentation is available here: https://traction-project.github.io/FaceObjRecognitionForCCSpace

## Installation

Follow the instructions at https://pytorch.org/ to install PyTorch for your
system using ether `conda` or `pip`. If you have a CUDA compatible graphics
card, ensure to install a CUDA comparible version of PyTorch to allow the
deep models to run on the GPU.

To install the `facerec` package and `facetool` console script, run:

```
pip install .
```

This will install the `facetool` script on your environment path.

## Co-Creation Space Integration

The `facerecdb.py` file integrates the face recognition module to Co-Creation Space. Once Co-Creation Space is running with AWS credentials set up in the AWS CLI, simply run the `facerecdb.py` file. Make sure database credentials are correct.
The module will add tags based on faces found to videos in the Co-Creation Space. For faces to be correctly tagged, upload to Co-Creation Space (i.e. create a post) at least one image of the faces of the individuals that appears in videos. Name the post with the name of the individual.

## Standalone Usage

To see the available commands, run:

```
facetool --help
```

The output will look something like:

```
usage: facetool [-h] {index,thumbnail,recognize_gui,recognize,detect,detect_camera_demo,track,download} ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

subcommands:
  {index,thumbnail,recognize_gui,recognize,detect,detect_camera_demo,track,download}
    index               Indexes a dataset of face images.
    thumbnail           Generate thumbnails for an input image folder.
    recognize_gui       Detect and recognize faces in images or video.
    recognize           Detect and recognize faces in images or video.
    detect              Detect faces and write bounding boxes to stdout.
    detect_camera_demo  Detect faces on the webcam and show the results in a GUI window.
    track               Detect faces and tracks them.
    download            Downloads and extracts the LFW dataset.
```


## Video face recognition

To use the video face recognition software, you'll first need to index a 
collection of faces to recognize. The software assumes that this collection
is stored in a folder with one subfolder per individual, each named with the
label you want to apply to that person. Inside these folders should be one or
more example images of the person.


### Indexing media

To index media run the following:

```
facetool index media/images media/index 
```
to create a `media/index` folder containing the indexed files. Add a 
`--device=cpu` to run this on the CPU. Indexing may take some time, especially
on a CPU (approx 30 mins).

### Outputting the results of recognition to the console

```
facetool recognize media/example.mp4 media/index --device cpu (--device is an optional parameter)
```

The output will look something like:
